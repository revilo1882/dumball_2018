# A Dumball Story

## Introduction

A private project to help my friends raise awareness for their taking part in the 2018 Dumball Rally for Teenage Cancer Trust.

## Motivation

To learn the basics of React, Routing in React, Sass, Gulp, React Photo Gallery and using the Google Maps Api.

## Installation

Clone the repository then in the command line run:

```bash
$ cd dumball_2018
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Or run the deployed app here: https://dumball-story.herokuapp.com/

## Further Work

- Test the project.
- Add Route rather than polyline to map.
- Imporve styling.
